# CalclatorWorkings
Yeah so personal project of mine is well a calculator. \
Currently supports * /+ - ^\
There is a total of ZERO error handling so you've been warned(for now)\
Also anything that's invalid is just ignored\
Also you can't straight put in a negative number yet\
There's also no square root yet\
Also you can't input floats either\
Basically for a number x it's \
$\{ x \mid x \in W \}$ Smth like that idk\
IDK how to put the actual W in a markdown file so that's the best you get\
Anyways I'll add more to it in the future but it's 6:30 am as of writing so not rn lol.\
Have fun\
extra: why tf is it so hard to get this out as a distrutable jar file bru.
